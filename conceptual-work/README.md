# Documents

Here, I assemble several documents in which I outline my positions
towards an *Educational Programming Environment* and related topics.

As I live in Germany, I also write content here in German, aimed at my
fellow countrymen. However, I mostly write in English - as best as I
can - as I want to reach interested people everywhere, especially
teachers. This will be used in schools and further developed through
the experiences gained in practical use. Thus, the project also aims
to be a starting point for practical research on the use of computers
for teaching in general, with a focus on programming as a versatile
epistemological tool.
