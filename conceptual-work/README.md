# Documents

Here, I assemble several documents in which I outline my positions
towards an *Educational Programming Environment* and related topics.

As I live in Germany, I also write content here in German, aimed at my
fellow countrymen. However, I mostly write in English - as best as I
can - as I want to reach interested people everywhere, especially
teachers. This will be used in schools and further developed through
the experiences gained in practical use. Thus, the project also aims
to be a starting point for practical research on the use of computers
for teaching in general, with a focus on programming as a versatile
epistemological tool.

It is remarkable that in 1971 a first paragraph about computer aided
education was already written like it could be written today.

Seymour Papert was enthusiastic about the Turtle from the very
start. And it is a wonderful tool in the way it is supposed to be, an
ennironment for exploring geometry.

But in the sense of *Logo* it appears also distracting from the rest
of the programming language. This is why this project is supposed to
start with the core language and manages the Turtle extension later.

Of course, the project started as a conceptual framework for teaching
mathematics by exploring it.

But anyway, it was also designed for manipulating language for those
who didn't care for math but for language.
